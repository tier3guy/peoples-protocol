# React Starter Template

This is a simple starter template for building React applications. The template provides a basic project structure and a sample component that renders a "Hello, World!" message.

## Usage

To use this starter template, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/tier3guy/create-react-app-starter-template
cd my-app
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```
npm start
```

The development server should be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.

To build the production-ready version of your application, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a build directory with optimized and minified files that you can deploy to a web server.

- Basic project structure with a sample component
